**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.
It enables applications that:
* **_Are context-aware:_** Connect the language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response, etc.)
* **_Reason:_** Rely on language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)

This framework consists of several parts.
* LangChain Libraries
* LangChain Templates
* LangServe
* LangSmith

Together, these products simplify the entire application lifecycle:
* Develop
* Productionize
* Deploy
